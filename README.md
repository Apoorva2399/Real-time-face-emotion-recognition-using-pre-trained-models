# Real-time-face-emotion-recognition-using-pre-trained-models
Here i have used two pre trained models namely 'FER' and 'DeepFace' in order to recognize the real time emotion of a person in frame. 
Deepface is a lightweight face recognition and facial attribute analysis and facial attributes includes age, gender, emotion and race of person in frame. Deepface is a hybrid face recognition framework wrapping state of the art models Face, FaceNet, OpenFace, DeepId, ArcFace, Dlib.
DeepFace library is mainly based on Keras and Tensorflow. DeepFace and FER model gives an accuracy around 97%.
